I'm excited to announce that I would be speaking at the MongoDB World '18 at the end of this month. I would be talking about "Digitizing Colossal Data: Using Tech to Disrupt the Legal Industry and Bring Forth Positive Change". 

Details for my talk are <a href= "https://www.mongodb.com/world18/session/174098">here</a>.
